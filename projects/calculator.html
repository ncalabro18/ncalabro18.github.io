            Overview
        </h3>

        <p>
            Can parse a mathematical equation into an abstract binary tree representation
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition the application has the ability to perform operations such as calculating a value, slope at a point,
            derivative, Taylor/MacLaurin series, and definite integrals
            <br>
            <br>
            Can also Graph the equation given its tree
            <br>
