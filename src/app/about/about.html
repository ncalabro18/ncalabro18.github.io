<br>
Highly motivated Software Engineer seeking full-time employment this May.
Internship experience included a program continuously transferring data from Elasticsearch to Postgres and an Angular web application used to parse invoice PDFs.
I implemented CI pipelines and extensive tests for both projects.
I have an in-depth understanding of developing on the Linux platform through coursework.
More details are below.


<h3>Education</h3>
<br>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science

<h4>Cogo Labs</h4>

Go Software Engineer Intern
<br>May 2020 to August 2020
<br>One Kendall Square, Suite B2102, Cambridge, MA 02139


<ul>
<li>Designed, implemented, deployed, and monitored two projects written in Go and TypeScript, each running in production Kubernetes containers deployed through Travis CI.</li>
<li>Developed both projects using Git while working with and learning from a team.</li>
<li>Planned and managed project progression using GitHub Issues to facilitate communication.</li>
<li>Requested and analyzed code reviews from other engineers, resulting in new improvements.</li>
<li>Implemented comprehensive Go test suites with broad code coverage, improving code quality.</li>
</ul>
<br><h5>Project: DMARC Reporter</h5>
Go | Postgres | Docker | Kubernetes | Prometheus | Sysdig | Git
<ul>
<li>Protected key revenue streams by implementing a DMARC reporter to ensure email deliverability.</li>
<li>Queried an Elasticsearch engine for thousands of daily DMARC report emails from providers.</li>
<li>Parsed the reports, encoded in zipped Base64 into raw XML, then inserted the XML report data into a Postgres database table, providing a PostgreSQL interface for company engineers.</li>
<li>Created a robust monitoring service with Prometheus and Sysdig to graph email failure rates, system status, and performance.</li>
<li>In the event of significant send failures, these interfaces will eliminate or flag DMARC, either DKIM or SPF, as point of failure reducing response times and lost revenue.</li>
</ul>
<br><h5>Project: Invoice Scraper</h5>
Go | TypeScript | Angular | Docker | Kubernetes | Git
<ul>
<li>Parsed submitted payments from invoice PDFs for leased IP addresses, automating a previously manual sysadmin task.</li>
<li>Developed an Angular web application to submit invoices and to display the parsed results.</li>
<li>Engineered a YAML-based configuration system for the invoice scraper backend, which facilitated the parsing of invoices from at least five different providers with varying syntax.</li>
<li>Prepared intuitive Markdown documentation about creating or changing configurations to minimize labor time if the invoice syntax changed or a new IP provider required parsing.</li>
<li>Incorporated optional output to display how the parser executes to indicate configuration errors, decreasing required manual time to configure the parser.</li>
</ul>
