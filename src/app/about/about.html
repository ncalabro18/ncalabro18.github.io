	Highly motivated Software Engineer seeking full-time employment this May.
	My internship experience included a Dockerized program continuously decoding and transferring data from Elasticsearch to Postgres, and an Angular web application used to parse invoice PDFs.
	I implemented CI pipelines and extensive tests for both projects.
	Expanded my development skills on the Linux platform through coursework.
	Awarded Eagle Scout in 2017.

<h3>Experience</h3>


<h4>Cogo Labs</h4>
<div class="meta">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Go Software Engineer Intern
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
	May 2020 to August 2020
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
	One Kendall Square, Suite B2102, Cambridge, MA 02139
</div>


<ul>
<li>Designed, implemented, deployed, and monitored two projects written in Go and TypeScript, each running in production Kubernetes containers deployed through Travis CI.</li>
<li>Developed both projects using Git while working with and learning from a team.</li>
<li>Planned and managed project progression using GitHub Issues to facilitate communication.</li>
<li>Requested and analyzed code reviews from other engineers, resulting in new improvements.</li>
<li>Implemented comprehensive Go test suites with broad code coverage, improving code quality.</li>
</ul>
<br><h5>Cogo Labs Project: DMARC Reporter</h5>
<p>&nbsp; Go | Postgres | Docker | Kubernetes | Prometheus | Sysdig | Git</p>
<ul>
<li>Protected key revenue streams by implementing a DMARC reporter to ensure email deliverability.</li>
<li>Queried an Elasticsearch engine for thousands of daily 
<abbr data-tip="Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance - determines if emails will be delivered based on DKIM and SPF results">
	DMARC
</abbr>

report emails from providers.</li>
<li>Parsed the reports, encoded in zipped Base64 into raw XML, then inserted the XML report data into a Postgres database table, providing a PostgreSQL interface for company engineers.</li>
<li>Created a robust monitoring service with Prometheus and Sysdig to graph email failure rates, system status, and performance.</li>
<li>In the event of significant send failures, these interfaces will eliminate or flag 
<abbr data-tip="DomainKeys Identified Mail - DNS record storing a public key for data integrity">
	DKIM
</abbr>
 or
<abbr data-tip="Sender Policy Framework - list of valid IP addresses that a domain may send emails from">
	SPF
</abbr>
 as the point of failure, reducing response times and lost revenue.</li>
</ul>
<br><h5>Cogo Labs Project: Invoice Scraper</h5>
<p>&nbsp; Go | TypeScript | Angular | Docker | Kubernetes | Git</p>
<ul>
<li>Parsed submitted payments from invoice PDFs for leased IP addresses, automating a previously manual sysadmin task.</li>
<li>Developed an Angular web application to submit invoices and to display the parsed results.</li>
<li>Engineered a YAML-based configuration system for the invoice scraper backend, which facilitated the parsing of invoices from at least five different providers with varying syntax.</li>
<li>Prepared intuitive Markdown documentation about creating or changing configurations to minimize labor time if the invoice syntax changed or a new IP provider required parsing.</li>
<li>Incorporated optional output to display how the parser executes to indicate configuration errors, decreasing required manual time to configure the parser.</li>
</ul>
